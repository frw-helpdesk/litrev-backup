    Overview of Integrating Across Studies

    A good review of research literature does not just describe
    and assess the applicable studies. It also integrates across them.
    The integration stage forges something new from the prior studies.
    This introductory lesson and the following five Integration lessons (I-2
    to I-6) will help you several ways of doing this.
    
    The "new" may come from a redefinition of a research problem, modification
    of conceptual framework applied to the problem, identification of methodological
    shortcomings in a body of research, or a best guess about the "truth" of
    some issue from a body of research with inconsistent results. The
    Search and Assessment stages of a literature review provide the foundation
    for the Integration stage.

    There are many ways of approaching integration. They can be grouped
    into the following six categories. Rarely would all six approaches
    be used simultaneously, but these indicate the range of possibilities:

    Portray: Paint a picture. Indicate the surface similarities
    and differences. Map out surface relationships. Identify the
    gaps.


  Trace History: Describe changes over time. Identify lineage.
  Situate the evolving research in a larger historical context. Identify
  causes and consequences of the evolution.



  Categorize: Sort into a taxonomy based on similarities and differences
  of underlying characteristics.



  Summarize: Identify main commonalities and central tendencies.
  Generalize and simplify.



  Undermine: Break up existing paradigms of thought by documenting
  obscure inadequacies that are widespread. Identify chaos in apparent
  order. Show the variation and complexity of the situation.



  Synthesize: Pull together into a new whole. Explain and reconcile
  apparent contradictions. Redefine. Identify order in apparent
  chaos.
            
    Enlightening integration rarely is achieved mechanically. It benefits
    from intuition, inspiration, and insight. It also requires verification
 and documentation. A scholar is expected to substantiate his or her
 integrations so that others can second-guess their validity and merit.
 As with the Search and Assessment stages of a literature review, a scholar's
beliefs, hopes, predispositions, and opinions can unintentionally, and
sometimes intentionally, bias the results of the Integration stage, making
them invalid, misleading, and dysfunctional. To avoid this, be cognizant
of your biases and rigorously verify and document the resulting integrations.
As a final check, ask yourself: were there any surprises in your integrations?
If not, you may have proceeded with blinders.
 
 The integration of research is a scholarly endeavor. Accordingly,
your conclusions are considered of little importance without careful documentation
of the evidence upon which they are based.
 
 There are at least five domains where integration can be undertaken
during reviews of the research literature. They are:

Research Problem: Undesirable human or social conditions, unsatisfactory
              findings of prior research, or inadequacies in conceptual frameworks or
              methodology of prior research.
            

            
              Conceptual Framework: The lens through which the problem is viewed-the
              worldviews, theories, perspectives, and/or constructs of prior research
              studies.
            

            
              Methodology: The research design, sampling, data collection, and
              analysis of prior research studies.
            

            
              Interventions: The experimental treatments, the innovative practices
              being demonstrated, and the naturally occurring events whose impacts are
              of interest.
            

            
              Findings: The results, conclusions, interpretations, predictions,
              and recommendations of prior research studies.

              Some reviews of research seek to integrate in only one of the five domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Reviews in preparation for major research studies, including dissertation
          research, should usually undertake some integration in all five areas,
          thus providing the best basis for new research that is likely to make a
          real contribution to knowledge.&nbsp;

          Other Integration Lessons
          This is the first of six brief lessons on integrating across research
            studies. The other lessons are as follows:&nbsp;
