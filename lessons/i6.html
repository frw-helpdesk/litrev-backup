        <td colspan="2">Research problems are often unsatisfactory human, organizational,
          or social situations for which a solution or mitigation is sought.&nbsp;
          But research problems also can focus on inadequacies or missed opportunities
          in the conceptual frameworks that previously have been applied to the research
          on a given topic, on inadequacies or missed opportunities in the methods
          used, or on inadequacies or missed opportunities in the interventions applied.&nbsp;
          In addition, research problems can arise from disappointing prior results,
          or from unresolved contradictions in the results.&nbsp;
          <p>Virtually any of the integrations suggested in Lessons I-1 through I-5
            can identify gaps, apparent inconsistencies, or other disappointments that
            might make a viable problem for further research.&nbsp;
