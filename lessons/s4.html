        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>PsycINFO</i> is the most comprehensive
        index to scholarly and professional literature in psychology.&nbsp; It
        now contains information for 1.5 million journal articles, book chapters,
        books, and dissertation, with some from as far back as the late 19th century.&nbsp;
        It currently indexes and abstracts about 1,400 journals, comprehensively
        covering the journals directly related to psychology and selectively covering
        others that sometimes have articles related to psychology.&nbsp;
        <p><b>Advantages</b>
        </p><ul>
        <li>
        <i>PsycINFO</i>'s coverage of the psychological literature is far greater
        than any other index.</li>
        
        <li>
        <i>PsycINFO</i> permits complex searches.</li>
        
        <li>
        Each resource has been assigned one or more of about 100 classification
        codes, making it easy to search broadly a sub-field of psychology.</li>
        
        <li>
        Each resource has also been assigned multiple index terms from the <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064805/http://liber.ithaca.edu/marion/ABP-0104">Thesaurus
        of Psychological Index Terms</a></i>, allowing narrow searches with a fixed
        vocabulary.</li>
        
        <li>
        Abstracts are provide online for all sources except the dissertations.</li>
        
        <li>
        Subscribers to the American Psychological Association's <i>Full Text Database</i>
        have online access to the full text of about 35 leading journals.&nbsp;
        The full text is generally available for issues published since 1990.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Pitfalls</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <i>PsycINFO</i> is available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064805/http://www.apa.org/">American
        Psychological Association</a>'s Web site only to members who subscribe
        to at least one APA journal.&nbsp; The same database, however, is available
        at almost all university libraries through many different vendors, either
        online or on CD-ROM.&nbsp;</li>
        
        <li>
        The main disadvantage is that only subscribers can access full text, and
        that is limited to 35 leading journals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following resources will help you use <i>PsycINFO</i> in a powerful
