        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>PsycINFO</i> is the most comprehensive
          index to scholarly and professional literature in psychology. It
          now contains information for 1.5 million journal articles, book chapters,
          books, and dissertation, with some from as far back as the late 19th century.
          It currently indexes and abstracts about 1,400 journals, comprehensively
          covering the journals directly related to psychology and selectively covering
          others that sometimes have articles related to psychology.
          <p><b>Advantages</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>PsycINFO</i>'s coverage of the psychological literature is far greater
              than any other index.
            </li>

            <li>
              <i>PsycINFO</i> permits complex searches.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each resource has been assigned one or more of about 100 classification
              codes, making it easy to search broadly a sub-field of psychology.</li>

            <li>
              Each resource has also been assigned multiple index terms from the <i><a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064805/http://liber.ithaca.edu/marion/ABP-0104">Thesaurus
                  of Psychological Index Terms</a></i>, allowing narrow searches with a fixed
              vocabulary.</li>

            <li>
              Abstracts are provide online for all sources except the dissertations.</li>

            <li>
              Subscribers to the American Psychological Association's <i>Full Text Database</i>
              have online access to the full text of about 35 leading journals.
              The full text is generally available for issues published since 1990.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Pitfalls</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>PsycINFO</i> is available on the <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064805/http://www.apa.org/">American
                Psychological Association</a>'s Web site only to members who subscribe
              to at least one APA journal. The same database, however, is available
              at almost all university libraries through many different vendors, either
              online or on CD-ROM.
            </li>

            <li>
              The main disadvantage is that only subscribers can access full text, and
              that is limited to 35 leading journals.</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../assets/map.gif" height="45" width="30" align="ABSCENTER"><b>Trail Guide</b>
