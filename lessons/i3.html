    <td colspan="2">Research is distinguished from other forms of investigation
    and knowing by undertaking systematic empirical inquiry.&nbsp; That is
    the case both for quantitative research and qualitative research.&nbsp;
    Both involve systematic procedures and both collect data--quantitative
    or qualitative.&nbsp;
    <p>Methodology is the systematic procedures of inquiry.&nbsp; It includes
    the methodological approach (experiments, surveys, case studies, ethnographies),
    the research design or emergent design, the sampling of the units of analysis,
    data collection instruments and procedures, and data analysis techniques.&nbsp;
    </p><p>Any but the newest topics of research have been studied with a variety
    of methodologies.&nbsp; That is desirable because all methodologies have
    weaknesses as well as strengths.&nbsp; Before conducting new research on
    a topic, it is often useful to integrate the methodologies that have been
    previously used on that topic.
    </p><p><b>Means of Integrating Methodologies</b>
    </p><ul>
    <li>
    <b>Portray:</b> Map out the methodologies that have been used in researching
    the topic.&nbsp; Indicate which have been most, which least, and other
    applicable methodologies that have not been used.<br clear="BOTH">
    <br></li>
    
    <li>
    <b>Trace History:</b> Describe changes in the methodologies used over the
    years.&nbsp; Indicate the reasons for those changes and the effects they
    had on the body of knowledge.&nbsp;</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Categorize: </b>Classify the methodologies according to their similarities
    and differences on several dimensions.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Summarize: </b>Summarize the methodologies by the main approaches used,
    disregarding relatively unimportant variations.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Undermine:</b> Identify possible serious shortcomings in the dominant
    methodology used or common serious shortcoming and several of the methodologies
    widely used.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Synthesize: </b>Suggest new or improved methodologies,<b><i> in the
    context of&nbsp; both the strengths and weakness</i></b> of previously
    used ones.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
