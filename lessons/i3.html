        <td colspan="2">Research is distinguished from other forms of investigation
          and knowing by undertaking systematic empirical inquiry.&nbsp; That is
          the case both for quantitative research and qualitative research.&nbsp;
          Both involve systematic procedures and both collect data--quantitative
          or qualitative.&nbsp;
          <p>Methodology is the systematic procedures of inquiry.&nbsp; It includes
            the methodological approach (experiments, surveys, case studies, ethnographies),
            the research design or emergent design, the sampling of the units of analysis,
            data collection instruments and procedures, and data analysis techniques.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Any but the newest topics of research have been studied with a variety
            of methodologies.&nbsp; That is desirable because all methodologies have
            weaknesses as well as strengths.&nbsp; Before conducting new research on
            a topic, it is often useful to integrate the methodologies that have been
            previously used on that topic.
