        <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="498">As mentioned in the home page of this Web
        site, the research literature can provide a useful mountain lookout that
        broadens and deepens your perspective of a topic and allows you to scout
        promising routes to distant objectives, but it can also be a snake pit
        filled with groundless rhetoric, invalid findings, and misleading conclusions.&nbsp;
        In addition, the available research on a given topic usually varies some
        in the questions or hypotheses addressed, the contexts in which the research
        is conducted, the interventions that are applied in experiments and demonstrations,
        and the research methods used.&nbsp; All these can affect the results and
        thus should be taken into account during the next step of the review process,
        synthesis across studies.
        <p><b>What causes invalid results and misleading conclusions in research
        studies?</b>&nbsp; Some are caused by incompetence, when the researchers
        are not adequately prepared to conduct the study.&nbsp; Some are due to
        constraints in resources (money, staff, time) and access that force scholars
        to conduct research that is less thorough and rigorous than they would
        desire.&nbsp; Some result from honest mistakes and others from carelessness.
        Finally some are due to duplicity--deliberately skewing the research so
        that it serves only to buttress preconceived opinions.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Most research journal editors have two knowledgeable scholars review
        each article submitted for publication.&nbsp; This is supposed to identify
        weaknesses and used either to request improvements or to reject the submitted
        article.&nbsp; <i>Ulrich's International Guide </i>to periodicals indicates
        which use peer review.&nbsp; University presses and commercial publishers
        of text books usually require peer review; most other commercial publishers
        do not use it.
        </p><p>Peer review definitely helps screen out the worst research, but there
        is compelling evidence that it allows considerable flawed research to reach
        print.&nbsp; For instance, in a study of 114 research articles sampled
        from 44 journals, the average expert ratings of the problem statements,
        research procedures, data analysis, and summary and conclusion were each
        “mediocre” (Ward, Hall, and Schramm, 1975).
        </p><p>The merit of a research study can be considered like a chain hanging
        from a stout crossbeam, holding up a heavy pallet of knowledge.&nbsp; If
        any one link has a major crack, the pallet is in danger of crashing to
        the floor.&nbsp; The links include the background preparation for the study,
        the conceptual framework, the questions or hypotheses addressed, the contexts
        prevailing during the study, the interventions actually applied in experiments
        and demonstrations, the methodology of the study, the results, and the
        conclusions inferred from the study.&nbsp;
        </p><p><b>Appraisal Guides</b>
        </p><p>The following are some general guidelines that should help when assessing
        individual research studies.&nbsp; The guidelines will be discussed broadly
        so that they are generally applicable to both quantitative and qualitative
        research, although not every discussion will be applicable to all research
        approaches.
        </p><ol>
        <li>
        <b>Titles sometimes have more hype than substance.</b>&nbsp; Don’t assume
        the title of a research article accurately reflects what was studied or
        the results.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;
        <li>
        <b>Try to assess the most thorough report of the research study.</b>&nbsp;
        Often there are three levels of reports: one intended mostly for policy
        makers and practitioners and focusing mostly on the interventions, results,
        and conclusions; one published in a research journal with moderate detail
        about the background, questions or hypotheses, methodology, and the results
        and conclusions; and one submitted to a funding agency with the most extensive
        detailing of the study.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;
        <li>
        <b>Not all cracks in the chain links will cause the pallet to fall.</b>&nbsp;
        Whether the chain will hold the pallet depends on the strength of the links,
        the depth of the cracks, and the weight of the pallet.&nbsp; Just as it
        is a mistake to assume every published research study can be relied upon,
        it is a mistake to assume that any shortcoming in a study makes it useless.&nbsp;
        Careful and wise judgment is needed when assessing the merit of individual
        research studies.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;
        <li>
        <b>Beware of your own biases.</b>&nbsp; Even seasoned scholars are quicker
        to identify the flaws in studies with results that contradict their opinions
        than those with results that support their opinions.&nbsp; Work consciously
        to exercise even-handed judgment.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;
        <li>
        <b>There are at least three levels of assessment.</b>&nbsp; These include:&nbsp;</li>
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        What are the characteristics of the study that may have affected the results?&nbsp;
        What are the implications?&nbsp; These questions are important to the synthesis
        phase of the review.&nbsp;</li>
        
        <li>
        Does the study validly answer the questions addressed or validly test the
        hypotheses posed?&nbsp; This is often referred to as “internal validity.”&nbsp;</li>
        
        <li>
        Are the results sufficiently large and/or generalizable to be important
        to theory, policy, and/or practice?&nbsp; This is often referred to as
        external validity.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;</ul>
        
        <li>
        <b>At the end of each Lesson A-2 through A-8 there are one or more “Key
        Appraisal Questions. ”&nbsp; </b>These will help you make a good assessment
        of the merit of each individual study that has been found during a literature
        search.&nbsp; The answers to these questions will also be important for
        the third phase of a literature review: the synthesis phase.&nbsp; Depending
        on the priority purposes of your review and the nature of the literature
        being reviewed, it may be important to address additional questions or
        sub-questions during the appraisal of each study.</li>
        
        <br>&nbsp;
        <li>
        <b>When assessing multiple research studies, code answers to the appraisal
        questions in a matrix.&nbsp; </b>The rows in the matrix should represent
        the studies and the columns the appraisal questions, or vice versa.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Other Assessment Lessons</b>
        <p>This is the first of eight brief lessons on assessing research literature.
        The other lessons are indicated below. For moderate competency in conducting
        literature reviews, one should master all the lessons.&nbsp;
