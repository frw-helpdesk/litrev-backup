      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="498">Scholarly research usually draws on prior
          studies, a conceptual framework or theory, and/or identified problems.&nbsp;
          These provide a rationale and focus for the study.&nbsp; When the background
          work is done well, the focus can put the study on the cutting edge of knowledge;
          when done poorly the study may repeat well-settled questions or pursue
          an inquiry that has proved fruitless.&nbsp; While focus allows for intensification
          of the investigation, it also inevitably delimits the generalizations that
          can be made from the study.&nbsp;
          <p>Most research is based partly on a review of prior research.&nbsp; The
            review may be used to test a speculation before devoting great time and
            expense to researching it, or the review may have provoked the research
            by identifying a problem that could benefit from research.&nbsp; The review
            can also be used to scout conceptual frameworks, theories, and methodologies
            that might be used in the research.&nbsp; If the research article or detailed
            report does not reference prior research on the topic, there is reason
            to worry that the investigator was an amateur or did a “quickie” study.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>The terms “theory” and “conceptual framework” are used in various way
            by researchers.&nbsp; Usually a conceptual framework refers to a set concepts
            applicable to a given phenomena that provide an special perspective of
            it.&nbsp; Theory usually refers to a conceptual framework that specifies
            causal relationships and which has been inferred from prior research and
            then verified with further research.&nbsp; New areas of research and much
            survey research directed at characterizing socio-demographic characteristics
            and opinions about current events will have no associated conceptual framework
            or theory.
          </p>
          <p>The most productive research is usually in response to a problem rather
            than mere curiosity.&nbsp; The problem makes the research of importance.&nbsp;
            The problem may be a gap in established knowledge, an apparent inconsistency
            or contradiction in present knowledge, the lack of a conceptual framework,
            or inadequacies in a theory.&nbsp; In qualitative research, the problem
            may be foreshadowed-that is suggested but not clearly evident.&nbsp; The
            problem is not always stated explicitly or clearly in research reports,
            but sometimes it is implicit.
          </p>
          <p>The background work for research provides the focus and lens for the
            research.&nbsp; This allows the investigator to see more acutely.&nbsp;
            But it also limits peripheral vision and thus bounds or “delimits” the
            study.&nbsp; Those delimitations are important for interpreting the results.&nbsp;
            It is not uncommon for the conclusions and recommendations of research
            reports to exceed the delimitations of the study.
