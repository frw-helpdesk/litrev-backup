        <td colspan="2" height="498">Scholarly research usually draws on prior
        studies, a conceptual framework or theory, and/or identified problems.&nbsp;
        These provide a rationale and focus for the study.&nbsp; When the background
        work is done well, the focus can put the study on the cutting edge of knowledge;
        when done poorly the study may repeat well-settled questions or pursue
        an inquiry that has proved fruitless.&nbsp; While focus allows for intensification
        of the investigation, it also inevitably delimits the generalizations that
        can be made from the study.&nbsp;
        <p>Most research is based partly on a review of prior research.&nbsp; The
        review may be used to test a speculation before devoting great time and
        expense to researching it, or the review may have provoked the research
        by identifying a problem that could benefit from research.&nbsp; The review
        can also be used to scout conceptual frameworks, theories, and methodologies
        that might be used in the research.&nbsp; If the research article or detailed
        report does not reference prior research on the topic, there is reason
        to worry that the investigator was an amateur or did a “quickie” study.&nbsp;
        </p><p>The terms “theory” and “conceptual framework” are used in various way
        by researchers.&nbsp; Usually a conceptual framework refers to a set concepts
        applicable to a given phenomena that provide an special perspective of
        it.&nbsp; Theory usually refers to a conceptual framework that specifies
        causal relationships and which has been inferred from prior research and
        then verified with further research.&nbsp; New areas of research and much
        survey research directed at characterizing socio-demographic characteristics
        and opinions about current events will have no associated conceptual framework
        or theory.
        </p><p>The most productive research is usually in response to a problem rather
        than mere curiosity.&nbsp; The problem makes the research of importance.&nbsp;
        The problem may be a gap in established knowledge, an apparent inconsistency
        or contradiction in present knowledge, the lack of a conceptual framework,
        or inadequacies in a theory.&nbsp; In qualitative research, the problem
        may be foreshadowed-that is suggested but not clearly evident.&nbsp; The
        problem is not always stated explicitly or clearly in research reports,
        but sometimes it is implicit.
        </p><p>The background work for research provides the focus and lens for the
        research.&nbsp; This allows the investigator to see more acutely.&nbsp;
        But it also limits peripheral vision and thus bounds or “delimits” the
        study.&nbsp; Those delimitations are important for interpreting the results.&nbsp;
        It is not uncommon for the conclusions and recommendations of research
        reports to exceed the delimitations of the study.
