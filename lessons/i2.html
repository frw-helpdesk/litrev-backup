    <td colspan="2">A conceptual framework provides one or more lens through
    which the research problem is viewed.&nbsp; The lens can be a worldview,
    such as Marxism or democracy, that informs a study.&nbsp; It can be theories,
    such as those of Freud, Piaget, and Kolberg, that explain certain phenomena
    in considerable detail.&nbsp; It can be research perspectives such as those
    of social psychologists, cognitive scientists, and economists.&nbsp; And
    it can be constructs used to conceptualize the phenomena of interest, such
    as reading comprehension, social isolation, and leadership.&nbsp;
    <p>For instance "teaching" can be conceptualized as communication, information
    transfer, interpersonal interaction, cognitive apprenticeship, the fostering
    of human development, socialization, human capital development, oppression,
    and/or liberation.&nbsp; The research questions that are considered interesting
    and promising depend partly on the conceptual framework adopted for a study.
    </p><p>Conceptual frameworks help the researcher view the phenomena of interest
    more acutely, to see details that otherwise might not be apparent.&nbsp;
    It should be noted, however, that like a microscope or telescope, conceptual
    frameworks also narrow one's field of vision.&nbsp; That helps limit the
    scope of a study, and no study can examine everything that might be applicable.&nbsp;
    It can, however, also lead a researcher to miss important features.&nbsp;
    </p><p>Most human and social phenomena have been researched with various different
    conceptual frameworks, although that may not be initially apparent if your
    search for literature is limited to terms used only in one conceptual framework.&nbsp;
    For instance, "constructivism" is general addressed in research using the
    relatively new conceptual framework of cognitive science, but Socrates
    anticipated constructivism, and there is research using classical learning
    theory that addresses issues now commonly considered the domain of cognitive
    science.&nbsp; If your literature search was limited to "constructivism"
    and related cognitive science terms, you will miss the other literature
    that addresses the same phenomena.&nbsp;
    </p><p><b>Means of Integrating Conceptual Frameworks</b>
    </p><p>The following are several means of integrating conceptual frameworks
    used in prior researches on a topic.
    </p><ul>
    <li>
    <b>Portray:</b> Map out the various worldviews, theories, research perspectives,
    and constructs that have been used on a given research topic, indicating
    the frequency of use, relationships among the various conceptual frameworks
    used, and potentially applicable frameworks that have not yet been used.&nbsp;</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Trace History:</b> Describe changes over the years in the conceptual
    frameworks that have been used.&nbsp; Identify reasons for the changes,
    the derivations of the changes, and the consequences of the changes.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Categorize: </b>Classify the conceptual frameworks used into a taxonomy
    based on underlying characteristics of the frameworks.&nbsp;</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Summarize: </b>Identify the main commonalities in the conceptual frameworks.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Undermine:</b> For well established conceptual frameworks, especially
    those that have become conventional wisdom, check whether there are extensive
    hidden shortcomings that raise serious doubts about the merit of the framework.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Synthesize: </b>Suggest a new or refined conceptual framework, conserving
    some of the strengths of the existing frameworks and redressing some of
    their weaknesses.&nbsp; Perhaps also draw partly on frameworks from other
    fields or topics of research.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
