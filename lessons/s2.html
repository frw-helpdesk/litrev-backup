                    and <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064800/http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a></i>, will
                    find you thousands
                    of sources on education, human resource development, and other matters,
                    but most of it will be from magazines, newspapers, and various organizations'
                    own Web pages, rather than from research journals and dissertations, which
                    are the main sources of research literature. This is because most
                    of the journals and dissertations are not yet available publicly on the
                    Web.
                    <p>So why bother with them? Search engines are often useful at the
                        very beginning of a search to get a quick view of a topic and at the very
                        end to find contact information for experts whom you wish to contact about
                        their on-going and just completed work. In addition, because the
                        Web and the search engines are evolving rapidly, it is likely that search
                        engines will become a better tool for locating research literature within
                        the next couple of years.
                    </p>
                    <p>To make the best use of Web search engines--to find what you need and
                        avoid an avalanche of irrelevant hits--you should pick two or three search
                        engines that are well suited to your needs and spend a few hours becoming
                        moderately proficient with each. Each works somewhat differently,
                        most importantly in respect to how you broaden or narrow a search.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note on Terminology: Many discussions of Web searching devices distinguish
                        between three types of Web searching devices: "Search engines" use software
                        to search and index the web according to keywords in the hidden "meta tags"
                        of Web pages and sometime the full text of the pages. "Directories"
                        or "subject guides" are indexes prepared by humans after examining the
                        pages on the Web. "Meta-search engines" use software that submits
                        a search to multiple search engines and directories. In this discussion,
                        all will be referred to as search engines.

                    <p><b>Advantages</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Search engines are a quick way to learn of popular topics, of some of the
                            people involved, and of related topics that you might not have considered.
                            This can inform your subsequent searches with <i><a

                            literature.</li>

                        <li>
                            Some of the best means for finding research literature do not provide the
                            full text online, nor do they hotlink to it when it exists elsewhere on
                            the Web. Once these means have given you citation information, you
                            can use a search engine to see if the source, or some derivative of it,
                            is available in full text online.</li>

                        <li>
                            People with unconventional views find it difficult to publish in the scholarly
                            literature, even when they have done a credible study, but they can easily
                            place their work on the Web.</li>

                        <li>
                            There are several searching engines that find people, and they might help
                            you track down an elusive expert with whom you wish to communicate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Pitfalls</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The search engines do <b>not</b> currently find much of the research literature.
                            This is because most of it is not yet posted publicly on the Web.</li>

                        <li>
                            The Web is huge and growing exponentially. Simple searches, using
                            a single word or phrase, will often yield thousands of "hits", most of
                            which will be irrelevant.</li>

                        <li>
                            The syntax (word order and punctuation) for various types of complex searches
                            varies some from search engine to search engine, and small errors in the
                            syntax can seriously compromise the search. For instance, asking
                            some search engines to find sources on education reform will find Web sites
                            containing either of those words, rather than those with the full phrase.</li>

                        <li>
                            None of the search engines indexes everything on the Web. A 1998 test found
                            that the percentage ranged from a high of 34 percent for <i>HotBot</i>
                            to 3 percent for <i>Lycos</i>.</li>

                        <li>
                            While some of the information on the Web is first-rate, the Web also has
                            much false, misleading, and deceptive information that has been produced
                            by charlatans and weirdos, some of which has been dressed to appear respectable.</li>

                        <li>
                            The search engines are mostly run by for-profit firms which haven't yet
                            made much profit, and there is a possibility they are taking fees to skew
                            their searches.</li>

                        <li>
                            The Web itself is unstable and the great source that you found yesterday
                            may be gone tomorrow.</li>

                        <li>
                            Similarly, many of the Web search engines are undergoing rapid development
                            and are not well documented. You will have only an approximate idea
                            of how they are working, and unknown shortcomings may cause them to miss
                            desired information.</li>

                        <li>
                            Meta-search engines allow you to submit one search to several search engines,
                            but complex searches are usually simplified, resulting in important misses
                            and/or many unwanted hits.</li>

                                learning how to use search engines. It provides relatively clear explanations
                                and has many interactive exercises that involve the actual use of search
                                engines. Those exercises will divide your screen into two “frames”
                                with the left side providing the instructions and the right side opening
                                and displaying the actual search engine. <i>Hint: You will have to

                                for each search engine is displayed on the left of your screen and the
                                search engine is displayed on the right of the screen. Both tutorials
                                are divided into multiple “sections”, each of which provides information,

                                    of the tutorial, click on “Next”. You will have to use the horizontal

                            Alfred and Emily Glossbrenner's <i>Search Engines for the World Wide Web</i>
                            provides an excellent guide to using search engines. For each popular
                            search engine, it explains, with illustrations of the search engine screens,
                            how to do simple and complex searches. Warning: Some parts of any
                            book on this subject are likely to be obsolete by the time the book leaves
                            the printers. Get the latest edition; the second edition came out
                            in early 1999. It is a bargain at $17.99.</li>

                        <li>
                            Most of the search engines have instructions for their use, but finding
                            the appropriate link in their cluttered home pages can be difficult.
                            Look for "Search Tips," "Simple Searches," "Advanced Searching," "Help,"
                            and "FAQ." Don't just look in the main part of the home page; also
                            look in the header and at the very bottom of the page.</li>

                            Semi-competance in your Web searches is generally not critical, because
                            search engines should not be relied upon to find most of the existing research
                            on a given topic.</li>

                        <li>
                            Most search engines have a "simple" and "advanced" search mode. If one
                            doesn't do the trick, try the other. The advanced mode usually provides
                            better guidance on how to do searches with multiple words or multiple phrases.</li>

                        <li>
                            See the general First Aid suggestions for dealing with insufficient hits
                            and too many hits that are provided toward the bottom of the page for the

                        <li>
                            Sometimes a search finds a long Web page and it is hard to find the discussions
                            relevant to your search. By clicking "Edit" and then "Find in Page"
                            most web browsers will find the discussion(s) that include your search
                            term.</li>

                        <li>
                            If one search engine fails you, try another, making sure to check its required
                            syntax for the complex searches that you may want to make.</li>

                        <li>
                            If all else fails, ask a reference librarian for help. Many have
