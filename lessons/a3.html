        <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="498">Questions or hypotheses provide further focus
        to a study.&nbsp; In qualitative research, the investigation may begin
        with a few or no questions, and generate questions from the observations.&nbsp;
        Survey research often has a few general questions, each of which are investigated
        with several additional more specific questions.&nbsp; Experimental research
        may start with questions, but translates them into hypotheses, which state
        tentative answers to specific questions of interest, usually postulating
        no difference, and then test the hypotheses.&nbsp;
        <p>There are four common types of research questions, and the type of question
        has critical implications for the appropriate research design.&nbsp;
        </p><ol type="a">
        <li>
        <b>Descriptive questions</b> (about the characteristics of something).&nbsp;
        Example: What is the average math achievement of the nation’s fourth graders?&nbsp;
        What is the career satisfaction of DC computer industry professional employees?</li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Associational questions </b>(about categorical differences or correlations).&nbsp;
        Example: How does the math achievement of the nation’s fourth grade Hispanic
        youth compare with that of the nation’s fourth grade African-American youth?&nbsp;
        Are District of Columbia computer industry professional employees more
        or less satisfied with their careers than are DC media industry professional
        employees?</li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Causal questions</b> (about what causes observed differences or changes).&nbsp;
        Example: What accounts for the wide variation in math achievement among
        fourth grade Hispanic youth?&nbsp; Will two hours a week of Math Explosion
        exercises over a semester raise the math achievement of low-achieving fourth
        grade Hispanic youth?</li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Benefit-cost questions</b> (about whether the benefits of a given intervention
        are worth more than the costs).&nbsp; Example: Do the benefits of Math
        Buster exercises exceed the costs of the computer laboratory, software,
        and laboratory supervision?&nbsp; Is the benefit/cost ratio of Math Explosion
        exercises greater than the benefit/cost ratio of after school tutoring
        by the teachers?</li>
        </ol>
        The first listed types of questions are generally easier to answer than
        the latter ones.&nbsp; For descriptive questions, there is only the need
        to measure the characteristics of interest in the population of interest.&nbsp;
        For associational questions, categorical comparisons or correlations then
        are computed for the measured characteristics.&nbsp; To answer causal questions,
        there is a need to establish (a) association, (b) temporal ordering (the
        alleged causal variables must occur before the outcome variables of interest),
        and (c) isolation (ascertaining that other variables may not have caused
        the outcomes).&nbsp; For benefit-cost questions, there is also a need to
        compare the value of the benefits to the costs of the intervention program.&nbsp;

        sure to distinguish among the four types of questions indicated above.)&nbsp;</dd>
