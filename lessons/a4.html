        <td colspan="2" height="498">All phenomena occur in contexts that may affect
          the phenomena.&nbsp; Experimental research strives to control the context
          and thus the effects it might have on the results, but that can rarely
          be done entirely.&nbsp; For instance, if male and female freshmen are tested
          in laboratory settings for responses to violent media, their reactions
          may differ from those in unobserved settings, and the differences for males
          may be greater or less than for females.&nbsp;
          <p>Qualitative research usually considers the contexts to be part of the
            phenomena of interest.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Since contexts may affect the results of a study and they usually vary
            within a set of studies on a given topic, it is important to take into
            account the contexts of studies when engaging in the integration phase
            of the review.&nbsp; There are hundreds of contexts that might affect the
            results of a study including the time in history, geography, social-economic
            conditions, cultural values, current events, and the array of other interventions
            to which students or employees may be subject.&nbsp; Which ones are likely
            to most affect the results is impossible to know with certainty, but prior
            research, theory, and intuition can help in identifying them.&nbsp; Note
            that the characteristics of the people, schools, businesses, or other units
            that are sampled are not properly considered contexts, but rather population
            characteristics, and will be discussed below in <a href="../lessons/a6.html">Lesson
              A-6</a>.&nbsp; While varying contexts in a set of studies on a topic can
            cause varying results, that will not always be the case.&nbsp; Sometimes
            the results are fairly consistent across studies undertaken in different
            contexts, and when so, this strongly suggests the observed findings are
            robust-not much affected by contexts.&nbsp;
