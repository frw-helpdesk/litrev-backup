        <td colspan="2" height="498">All phenomena occur in contexts that may affect
        the phenomena.&nbsp; Experimental research strives to control the context
        and thus the effects it might have on the results, but that can rarely
        be done entirely.&nbsp; For instance, if male and female freshmen are tested
        in laboratory settings for responses to violent media, their reactions
        may differ from those in unobserved settings, and the differences for males
        may be greater or less than for females.&nbsp;
        <p>Qualitative research usually considers the contexts to be part of the
        phenomena of interest.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Since contexts may affect the results of a study and they usually vary
        within a set of studies on a given topic, it is important to take into
        account the contexts of studies when engaging in the integration phase
        of the review.&nbsp; There are hundreds of contexts that might affect the
        results of a study including the time in history, geography, social-economic
        conditions, cultural values, current events, and the array of other interventions
        to which students or employees may be subject.&nbsp; Which ones are likely
        to most affect the results is impossible to know with certainty, but prior
        research, theory, and intuition can help in identifying them.&nbsp; Note
        that the characteristics of the people, schools, businesses, or other units
        that are sampled are not properly considered contexts, but rather population
        characteristics, and will be discussed below in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065631/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/a06.html">Lesson
        A-6</a>.&nbsp; While varying contexts in a set of studies on a topic can
        cause varying results, that will not always be the case.&nbsp; Sometimes
        the results are fairly consistent across studies undertaken in different
        contexts, and when so, this strongly suggests the observed findings are
        robust-not much affected by contexts.&nbsp;
