      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>ABI/Inform</i> is the best index and database
          of scholarly and professional literature on business and management topics.
          It covers about 3,300 journals, trade periodicals, general business magazines,
          and newspapers. The coverage for many dates back to 1971. An
          unusual feature of <i>ABI/Inform</i> is that it provides not only an abstract
          for many articles, but also the full text. <i>ABI/Inform</i> is available
          by subscription and GWU subscribes to it.
          <p><b>Advantages</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>ABI/Inform</i> has broad and deep coverage of the scholarly, professional,
              and popular literature in business and management.
            </li>

            <li>
              It permits complex searches.</li>

            <li>
              It provides the full text for many sources in two formats. The "Full
              Text" format loads quickly; the "Page Image" loads more slowly but provides
              all the graphics.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Pitfalls</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>ABI/Inform</i> is the main database in what is now called ProQuest.
              When you start <i>ABI/Inform</i> from the Gelman Web site, you see <i>ABI/Inform</i>
              only as a database to select for searching. After that the header
              only says ProQuest.
            </li>

            <li>
              <i>ABI/Inform</i> does not index doctoral dissertations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../assets/map.gif" height="45" width="30"><b>Trail Guide</b>

            <li>
              GWU students can access <i>ABI/Inform</i> from on-campus computers by going
              to Gelman Library's home page at <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064807/http://www.gwu.edu/~gelman">www.gwu.edu/gelman</a>.

          </ol>

          <img src="../assets/aid.gif" height="30" width="30"><b>First Aid</b>
          <p>If you encounter trouble when doing <i>ABI/Inform</i> searches, review
            the Trail Guides again. For complex searches it may be easier to
            use the "Advanced" search option (click on the tab above the search statement
            dialog box) than the "Basic" search. If you still need help, ask
            for assistance from a reference librarian. Search assistance from
            the vendor (Bell and Howell) is available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.
            to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time at 1-800-889-3358.
