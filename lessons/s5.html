        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>ABI/Inform</i> is the best index and database
        of scholarly and professional literature on business and management topics.&nbsp;
        It covers about 3,300 journals, trade periodicals, general business magazines,
        and newspapers.&nbsp; The coverage for many dates back to 1971.&nbsp; An
        unusual feature of <i>ABI/Inform</i> is that it provides not only an abstract
        for many articles, but also the full text.&nbsp; <i>ABI/Inform</i> is available
        by subscription and GWU subscribes to it.&nbsp;
        <p><b>Advantages</b>
        </p><ul>
        <li>
        <i>ABI/Inform</i> has broad and deep coverage of the scholarly, professional,
        and popular literature in business and management.</li>
        
        <li>
        It permits complex searches.</li>
        
        <li>
        It provides the full text for many sources in two formats.&nbsp; The "Full
        Text" format loads quickly; the "Page Image" loads more slowly but provides
        all the graphics.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Pitfalls</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <i>ABI/Inform</i> is the main database in what is now called ProQuest.&nbsp;
        When you start <i>ABI/Inform</i> from the Gelman Web site, you see <i>ABI/Inform</i>
        only as a database to select for searching.&nbsp; After that the header
        only says ProQuest.</li>
        
        <li>
        <i>ABI/Inform</i> does not index doctoral dissertations.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="/web/20190623064807im_/https://www2.gwu.edu/~litrev/aid.gif" height="30" width="30" align="ABSCENTER"><b>First Aid</b>
        <p>If you encounter trouble when doing <i>ABI/Inform</i> searches, review
        the Trail Guides again.&nbsp; For complex searches it may be easier to
        use the "Advanced" search option (click on the tab above the search statement
        dialog box) than the "Basic" search.&nbsp; If you still need help, ask
        for assistance from a reference librarian.&nbsp; Search assistance from
        the vendor (Bell and Howell) is available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.
        to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time at 1-800-889-3358.&nbsp;
