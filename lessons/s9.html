        <td colspan="2">Search tools for finding scholarly and professional literature
          have rapidly migrated to the Web. The literature itself, however,
          is making the transition more slowly. Consequently, the almost instant
          gratification of Web searches is often accompanied by painfully slow retrieval
          of the actual publications. If you are lucky, they are buried in
          your library and not mis-shelved or stolen. Others were never acquired
          by your library, and that leaves you with slow inter-library loans.
          <p>Within a few years, this frustration will largely be a thing of the
            past, although there will be a charge to one's library or to the individual
            user for accessing some of the material. Meanwhile some scholarly
            and professional literature is on the Web, and more will be appearing weekly.
            The most available on the Web are reports commissioned by government agencies,
            those conducted by scholarly and professional associations, and those published
            with accompanying advertisement. Least available are the last year
            or two of issues of the major journals in a field.
          </p>
          <p>Note of caution: Not all published journals provide high quality
            scholarly and professional literature. Some are little more than
            platforms for the rhetoric of small interest groups. That has always
            been true of some print journals, and it is even more common among the
            burgeoning number of "electronic journals" that are published only on the
            Web. See Lessons A-1 to A-7 for guidance on how to judge the quality
            of individual articles or reports.
