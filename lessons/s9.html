        <td colspan="2">Search tools for finding scholarly and professional literature
        have rapidly migrated to the Web.&nbsp; The literature itself, however,
        is making the transition more slowly.&nbsp; Consequently, the almost instant
        gratification of Web searches is often accompanied by painfully slow retrieval
        of the actual publications.&nbsp; If you are lucky, they are buried in
        your library and not mis-shelved or stolen.&nbsp; Others were never acquired
        by your library, and that leaves you with slow inter-library loans.&nbsp;
        <p>Within a few years, this frustration will largely be a thing of the
        past, although there will be a charge to one's library or to the individual
        user for accessing some of the material.&nbsp; Meanwhile some scholarly
        and professional literature is on the Web, and more will be appearing weekly.&nbsp;
        The most available on the Web are reports commissioned by government agencies,
        those conducted by scholarly and professional associations, and those published
        with accompanying advertisement.&nbsp; Least available are the last year
        or two of issues of the major journals in a field.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Note of caution:&nbsp; Not all published journals provide high quality
        scholarly and professional literature.&nbsp; Some are little more than
        platforms for the rhetoric of small interest groups.&nbsp; That has always
        been true of some print journals, and it is even more common among the
        burgeoning number of "electronic journals" that are published only on the
        Web.&nbsp; See Lessons A-1 to A-7 for guidance on how to judge the quality
        of individual articles or reports.&nbsp;
