        <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="896">There are five key characteristics of research
        results: direction, magnitude, variance (of averages and summaries), statistical
        significance (when hypothesis testing), and consistency within the study.&nbsp;
        The importance and implications of the results depends on all five.&nbsp;
        <p>While the importance of the direction and magnitude of results is obvious,
        these characteristic sometimes go unreported.&nbsp; There are thousands
        of correlations reported in the research literature without an indication
        of whether they were positive or negative correlations.&nbsp; There are
        thousands of experimental differences reported as statistically significant
        without an indication of the magnitude of the difference.&nbsp; Qualitative
        research is usually reported in more detail so direction rarely goes unreported.&nbsp;
        Qualitative analysis, however, often provides ambiguous indications of
        magnitude.&nbsp; If it says, “the entry-level employees were initially
        delighted by the firm’s offer to provide tuition assistance at the local
        community college” does that mean all, most or many of the entry level
        employees?&nbsp; And if the qualifier “most” is added to the statement,
        does that mean at least 90 percent, 80 percent, or 70 percent?&nbsp;
        </p><p>Averages or summaries simplify complexity and that is often helpful,
        but they can also hide important information.&nbsp; It is very easy to
        accompany mean values with the variance, and that adds considerable information.&nbsp;
        Some qualitative researchers are careful to report observed variations,
        but others, in their effort to indicate themes and patterns, don’t provide
        a sense of the variation.&nbsp;
        </p><p>While statistical significance is usually reported in quantitative research,
        it is widely misinterpreted by researchers and by readers.&nbsp; When the
        samples are small (less than 100), a failure to find statistical significance
        may mean there is no difference in the population or it may mean that there
        is a modest difference that was not inferred because of the inadequate
        power of the test.&nbsp; The power of all statistical tests is positively
        affected by sample size and inversely affected by the variance in the samples.&nbsp;
        Conversely, a finding of statistical significance from large samples (greater
        than 1,000) can result from trivial differences.&nbsp; Furthermore, it
        should also be noted that when 100 hypotheses are tested at the .05 level
        of significance, there is a good chance of finding about 5 statistically
        significant results by chance when there are no real differences in the
        population.
        </p><p>Most quantitative research involves multiple results, and the pattern
        of the results is far more important than any one by itself.&nbsp; For
        that reason, it is important that the report indicate all the results,
        but that may not be the case.&nbsp; Researchers will usually report all
        their statistically significant results, but they sometimes fail to report
        some or all of the results that were not significant.&nbsp; The following
        example will illustrate how this can be grossly misleading. In a study
        of the effects of Math Explosion software on Hispanic youths, it might
        be reported that the intervention had statistically significant results
        for mathematical computation skills.&nbsp; That seems interesting and encouraging
        until you learn that four other measures of math achievement did not show
        statistically significant results!&nbsp; The full set of measures might
        have included a standardized achievement test with scores for computation,
        concepts, and problem-solving; the students’ math course grades; and their
        quantitative score on the SAT college admissions test.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Qualitative researchers don’t have any device comparable to statistical
        significance.&nbsp; That makes the pattern of their results even more important
        than in quantitative research.&nbsp; Good qualitative research explicitly
        cross- verifies important results (“triangulate”) and indicates when some
        but not all of the evidence points in a given direction.&nbsp;
        </p><p>How can you ascertain whether a research report indicates all the results?&nbsp;
        Sometimes it will say that is has or has not.&nbsp; Sometimes more measures
        are discussed in the data collection section than are reported in the results
        section of the report.&nbsp; In addition, the following three conditions
        that should raise concerns about selective reporting of the results:&nbsp;
        </p><ol>
        <li>
        <b>Do all the reported hypothesis tests have statistically significant
        results?</b>&nbsp; Rarely are all the results significant except when five
        or more significance tests are conducted.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Are all the reported results consistent?&nbsp; </b>For instance, do
        all the results favor a demonstrated innovation or do all show a given
        social arrangement to be dysfunctional?&nbsp; Since social phenomena are
        rarely perfectly consistent, high consistency in the results suggests selective
        reporting by the researcher.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Is there an indication that the researcher was surprised by some of
        the results?</b> This is usually found toward the end of the report.&nbsp;
        It is almost impossible to do honest research without encountering some
        surprises and being intrigued by them.&nbsp; If the researcher found no
        surprises, it is possible that the whole study was skewed to support his
        or her pre-held opinions or that selective reporting buried unwanted results.</li>
        </ol>
        Just as the pattern of results within each study is important for interpreting
        a given study, during the integration stage of a literature review, the
        larger pattern of results across studies becomes critical.&nbsp; That will
        be discussed in the following section of this Web site.&nbsp;
