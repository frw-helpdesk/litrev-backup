                is the most authoritative database for information regarding doctoral dissertations
                and master’s theses from over 1,000 graduate schools and universities.
                Coverage of dissertation information began in 1861 with only reference
                citations. However, since 1980 it has included searchable abstracts
                of doctoral dissertations, and since 1988 carried abstracts of theses.
                Full texts of more than one million dissertations and theses can be ordered

                  the procedures for borrowing from a Consortium institution. The request
                  is processed in about a week, and you will receive notification by phone
                  when the dissertation is ready for pick-up. If the dissertation comes
                  from a non-Consortium institution, place a request at the Interlibrary
                  Loan Window. It would take about three to five weeks to process the
