            UMI/ProQuest Digital Dissertations
            is the most authoritative database for information regarding doctoral dissertations
            and master’s theses from over 1,000 graduate schools and universities.
            Coverage of dissertation information began in 1861 with only reference
            citations. However, since 1980 it has included searchable abstracts
            of doctoral dissertations, and since 1988 carried abstracts of theses.
            Full texts of more than one million dissertations and theses can be ordered
            in paper and microfilm formats from the vendor.

            Advantages

          <ul class="times">
            <li>
              UMI/ProQuest has broad
              and deep coverage of dissertations and theses in the humanities, social
              sciences, natural sciences and engineering.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each year presents in
              full text two award-winning entrees to the Council Graduate Schools/UMI
              Distinguished Dissertation Award contest. Winning entrees are rotated
              between the two areas of humanities &amp; social sciences and the natural
              sciences &amp; engineering.
            </li>

            <li>
              It has two ways of doing
              searches. There is the regular search with basic and advance features
              that uses author, keyword, subject, etc. fields. There is the “browse”
              search that allows searches according to subject or discipline headings.
            </li>

            <li>
              GWU automatically submits
              approved dissertations, with very few exceptions. Submission of theses
              is on a voluntary, and according to the school’s discretion. For
              more information on how to submit a dissertation or a thesis electronically,

            Pitfalls
          </b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              UMI/ProQuest is often
              referred to as “ProQuest Digital Dissertations” except a few instances.
            </li>

            <li>
              UMI/ProQuest provides
              full text for a fee. Although in its “About ProQuest Digital Dissertations”
              it refers you to free downloadable full text, in reality most universities
              do not subscribe to this service.
            </li>

            <li>
              Most, but not all universities
              and graduate schools, submit dissertations and theses to this service.
              For instance, Harvard does not. In their listings, UMI/ProQuest would
              give a dissertation or thesis number if they have the text or state that
              they do not carry it.

            <br>
            <p>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              b) You can also order

              copy that is sent within five to seven days by priority mail, to $46.00

            <p>
              c) You can also purchase
              an unbound paper copy at a reduced rate through Dissertation Express, a
              service offered to students and faculty of GWU. To place an order
              through Dissertation Express, go to the Interlibrary Loan Window located
              at the far end of Gelman Library, first floor, near the copy machines.
              The window is open from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
              (Hours do vary by semester, so check the posted times). Fill out
              the order form with the dissertation or thesis publication number.
              During off-hours you may submit the completed form at the drop box.
              Orders are usually processed within three to five days. The cost
              is $10.00 each for the first five texts per semester per student/faculty
              member, and $21.50 for each subsequent text. There are no page length
              limits. Dissertation Express will deliver your order in about three
              to five business days.
              <br>
            </p>
            <li>
              You can also borrow paper
              copies of dissertations and theses. If the dissertation or thesis
              comes from a Washington Regional Library Consortium-institution, then follow
              the procedures for borrowing from a Consortium institution. The request
              is processed in about a week, and you will receive notification by phone
              when the dissertation is ready for pick-up. If the dissertation comes
              from a non-Consortium institution, place a request at the Interlibrary
              Loan Window. It would take about three to five weeks to process the
              request, depending on distance and availability.

            If you encounter trouble
            when doing UMI/ProQuest searches, review the Trail Guides again.
            For more complex searches, it may be easier to use the “Advanced” search
            option (click on the tab above the search statement dialog box instead
            of the default “Basic” search. If you still need help, ask for assistance
            from a reference librarian. Assistance in searches, orders, etc.
