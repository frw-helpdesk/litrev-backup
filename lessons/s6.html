        is the most authoritative database for information regarding doctoral dissertations
        and master’s theses from over 1,000 graduate schools and universities.&nbsp;
        Coverage of dissertation information began in 1861 with only reference
        citations.&nbsp; However, since 1980 it has included searchable abstracts
        of doctoral dissertations, and since 1988 carried abstracts of theses.&nbsp;
        Full texts of more than one million dissertations and theses can be ordered
        in paper and microfilm formats from the vendor.&nbsp;</font></font></h1>
        <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">Advantages</font></font></b>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">UMI/ProQuest has broad
        and deep coverage of dissertations and theses in the humanities, social
        sciences, natural sciences and engineering.</font></font></li>

        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">It has two ways of doing
        searches.&nbsp; There is the regular search with basic and advance features
        that uses author, keyword, subject, etc. fields.&nbsp; There is the “browse”
        search that allows searches according to subject or discipline headings.</font></font></li>
        
        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">GWU automatically submits
        approved dissertations, with very few exceptions.&nbsp; Submission of theses
        is on a voluntary, and according to the school’s discretion.&nbsp; For
        more information on how to submit a dissertation or a thesis electronically,
        please see “UMI’s Guidelines for Submitting Electronic Theses and Dissertations”

        <ul>
        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">UMI/ProQuest is often
        referred to as “ProQuest Digital Dissertations” except a few instances.</font></font></li>
        
        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">UMI/ProQuest provides
        full text for a fee.&nbsp; Although in its “About ProQuest Digital Dissertations”
        it refers you to free downloadable full text, in reality most universities
        do not subscribe to this service.</font></font></li>
        
        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">Most, but not all universities
        and graduate schools, submit dissertations and theses to this service.&nbsp;
        For instance, Harvard does not.&nbsp; In their listings, UMI/ProQuest would
        give a dissertation or thesis number if they have the text or state that
        they do not carry it.</font></font></li>

        <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">There are several ways
        to obtain a copy of a dissertation or thesis.&nbsp; In order from the fastest

        <br>&nbsp;
        <p>&nbsp;
        </p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">a) Electronically formated
        dissertations and theses can be readily ordered downloaded.&nbsp; Texts

        </p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">b) You can also order
        a hard copy from UMI.&nbsp; Prices range from $29.95 for an unbound paper
        copy that is sent within five to seven days by priority mail, to $46.00
        for a hardcover bound copy that takes about three to four weeks weeks.&nbsp;

        </p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">c) You can also purchase
        an unbound paper copy at a reduced rate through Dissertation Express, a
        service offered to students and faculty of GWU.&nbsp; To place an order
        through Dissertation Express, go to the Interlibrary Loan Window located
        at the far end of Gelman Library, first floor, near the copy machines.&nbsp;
        The window is open from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.&nbsp;
        (Hours do vary by semester, so check the posted times).&nbsp; Fill out
        the order form with the dissertation or thesis publication number.&nbsp;
        During off-hours you may submit the completed form at the drop box.&nbsp;
        Orders are usually processed within three to five days.&nbsp; The cost
        is $10.00 each for the first five texts per semester per student/faculty
        member, and $21.50 for each subsequent text.&nbsp; There are no page length
        limits.&nbsp; Dissertation Express will deliver your order in about three
        to five business days.</font></font>
        <br>&nbsp;
        </p><li>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+0">You can also borrow paper
        copies of dissertations and theses.&nbsp; If the dissertation or thesis
        comes from a Washington Regional Library Consortium-institution, then follow
        the procedures for borrowing from a Consortium institution.&nbsp; The request
        is processed in about a week, and you will receive notification by phone
        when the dissertation is ready for pick-up.&nbsp; If the dissertation comes
        from a non-Consortium institution, place a request at the Interlibrary
        Loan Window.&nbsp; It would take about three to five weeks to process the
        request, depending on distance and availability.</font></font></li>
