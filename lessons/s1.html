                    and abroad has been expanding exponentially. This introductory lesson
                    and the following nine Search lessons (S-2 to S-10) will help you find
                    what you need efficiently.
                    <p>
                        <b>What is a Good Search?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>The answer depends on the purpose of the search. For a research
                        paper in a masters degree course, it often is a search that locates several
                        authoritative studies on the topic. For the literature review of
                        a dissertation, a good search locates at least most of the first-rate research
                        literature on the topic, perhaps some additional scholarly and professional
                        literature on the topics, and perhaps some first-rate literature on topics
                        closely related to yours.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is rare that you can find a search tool and target the search so
                        well that it finds all that you want and little else. If you target
                        narrowly, you are likely to miss some valuable literature. If you
                        do a broad search, you may find thousands of citations, most of which will
                        not be relevant.
                    </p>

                        <b>Which Search Tools Are Best?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of tools for searching the social science literatures.

                        is currently publicly available on the Web. Indexes to the scholarly

                    <p>The several Search lessons on this Web site offer instructions in how
                        to use the search tools that are most useful for locating the research
                        literature in the fields of education, human development, and human resource
                        development. These tools can also be useful when searching related
                        fields in the social sciences. Some of the described tools are publicly
                        accessible without charge on the Web. Others are available only through
                        libraries or other organizations that subscribe to them. All the
                        tools described in the following Search lessons were available in Fall
                        1999 either publicly or privately to the The George Washington University

                    </p>
                    <p>The following is a good strategy for targeting a search, and it is usually
                        best to undertake the steps in the order that they are listed. Steps
                        (1) – (5) are usually sufficient when preparing a paper for a masters degree
                        class. Steps (6) – (7) are generally expected for reviews of the
                        literature that are part of dissertation research.

                            and <i>ABI/Inform</i> are the best ways to find most of the “heavy duty”

                            respectively. Various other search tools allow you to search for
                            the Web sites of professional associations, government agencies, and research
                            centers, and those Web sites often include the full text of reports.

                        Complex Searches:
                    </b>
                    <p>The simplest searches use a single word and often yield an unmanageable
                        number of hits. Complex searches use multiple words, but the complexity
                        arises not from the number of words, but rather the logical relationship
                        you intend to specify among them and by the syntax that the search tool
                        requires for representing that relationship. To complicate matters,
                        the various search tools differ some in the syntax that they require.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are five common relationships between multiple words in a search
                        statement. They are described in order from those relationships that
                        result in a broad search to those that result in a narrow search.

                        <b>“OR” relationship:</b>This
                        means that you want to find resources that are indexed by any of the words
                        in the search term. EXAMPLE: test OR books -- This will find all
                        resources associated with the term "test" and also all associated with
                        the term "books". Some of the found resources will be associated
                        with both terms, but some will have only one of them.
                        <p><b>“AND” relationship:</b> This means that you want to find resources
                            that are indexed by both the words in the search term. EXAMPLE: test
                            AND book--This will find only the resources that are associated with both
                            of the terms. Note that counter-intuitively, this is a narrower search

                        <p><b>“NEAR” relationship:</b> This is the same as an “AND” relationship
                            except the different words have to be in close proximity (usually within
                            about 5 words of each other). EXAMPLE: test NEAR book--This will
                            find only the resources associated with both terms found close together
                            such as "test books," "test of books", "books having a test", etc.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>“NOT” relationship:</b> This means that you want to find resources
                            that are indexed by the word(s) prior to the "NOT" in the search term and
                            are not indexed by the word(s) following the "NOT". EXAMPLE: test

                    <p>Important Note: Not all search systems support all the above five search
                        relationships. Not all specify the relationships with the terms indicated
                        above. Finally, when two or more relationships are specified, the
                        order in which they are executed will affect the results, and that order
                        will depend on the search tool and perhaps how you exercise the option
                        to specify the order. When you need to use compound search statements,
                        make sure to read the documentation for the search mechanism to see how
                        to correctly specify the search.

                    </p>
                    <p>Searches for literature often can search different parts of the database
                        records for the indexed resources. These parts are described in the
                        order from those that usually result in a narrow search to those that usually
                        result in a broad search.
                    </p>

                        fields such as those for title, author, classification codes, and descriptors.
                        Some search systems refer to descriptors as "index terms" or "keywords".
                        <p><b>Search the abstract:</b> This scans the text of the abstract of the
                            publication, if one is available.

                    </blockquote>
                    Not all search systems permit all four of the above indicated domains of
                    the search. Various systems have different citation fields.
                    Occasionally a search of descriptors will actually result in a broader
                    search than a search of the full text, even though rarely are more than
                    20 descriptors assigned to a report; that will happen if a human indexer
                    realizes the report is relevant to a topic that is never mentioned in the
                    report, and assigns it the descriptor for that topic.
                    <p><b>"Wildcards" and "Truncation Symbols"</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Computers are literal. If you search for "elementary schooling"
                        they will ignore phrases like "elementary school," and "elementary schools"
                        unless told to do otherwise. This is not a problem when a human indexer
                        assigns a descriptor from the search system thesaurus, because the thesaurus
                        will exclude trivial variations of a term. But it is a problem when
                        searching titles, abstracts, and full text. Many search tools allow
                        you to use "wildcards" or "truncation symbols" to indicate the search should
                        include all possible prefixes and/or suffixes of a specified root word.

                                schooling, schooled) to search for all possible endings.

                                with a space between each; others require an “OR” between each word).
