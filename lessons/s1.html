                    and the following nine Search lessons (S-2 to S-10) will help you find
                    what you need efficiently.&nbsp;

                    </p>
                    <p>The answer depends on the purpose of the search.&nbsp; For a research
                        paper in a masters degree course, it often is a search that locates several
                        authoritative studies on the topic.&nbsp; For the literature review of
                        a dissertation, a good search locates at least most of the first-rate research
                        literature on the topic, perhaps some additional scholarly and professional
                        literature on the topics, and perhaps some first-rate literature on topics
                        closely related to yours.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>It is rare that you can find a search tool and target the search so
                        well that it finds all that you want and little else.&nbsp; If you target
                        narrowly, you are likely to miss some valuable literature.&nbsp; If you
                        do a broad search, you may find thousands of citations, most of which will
                        not be relevant.&nbsp;

                    <p>The simplest searches use a single word and often yield an unmanageable
                        number of hits.&nbsp; Complex searches use multiple words, but the complexity
                        arises not from the number of words, but rather the logical relationship
                        you intend to specify among them and by the syntax that the search tool
                        requires for representing that relationship.&nbsp; To complicate matters,
                        the various search tools differ some in the syntax that they require.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>There are five common relationships between multiple words in a search
                        statement.&nbsp; They are described in order from those relationships that

                            a narrower search than one with an "OR" relationship.&nbsp;

                    <p>Important Note: Not all search systems support all the above five search
                        relationships. Not all specify the relationships with the terms indicated
                        above.&nbsp; Finally, when two or more relationships are specified, the
                        order in which they are executed will affect the results, and that order
                        will depend on the search tool and perhaps how you exercise the option
                        to specify the order.&nbsp; When you need to use compound search statements,
                        make sure to read the documentation for the search mechanism to see how
                        to correctly specify the search.&nbsp;

                    <p><b>Domains of the Search</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Searches for literature often can search different parts of the database
                        records for the indexed resources.&nbsp; These parts are described in the
                        order from those that usually result in a narrow search to those that usually
                        result in a broad search.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <blockquote><b>Search specified citation fields: </b>This scans citation
                        fields such as those for title, author, classification codes, and descriptors.&nbsp;
                        Some search systems refer to descriptors as "index terms" or "keywords".
                        <p><b>Search the abstract:</b> This scans the text of the abstract of the
                            publication, if one is available.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Search the full text:</b> This scans all the text of the full publication,
                            if it is available in the database.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Search All: </b>This scans all text, the abstract, and all citation
                            fields.&nbsp; It combines each of the three searches indicated below.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    Not all search systems permit all four of the above indicated domains of
                    the search.&nbsp; Various systems have different citation fields.&nbsp;
                    Occasionally a search of descriptors will actually result in a broader
                    search than a search of the full text, even though rarely are more than
                    20 descriptors assigned to a report; that will happen if a human indexer
                    realizes the report is relevant to a topic that is never mentioned in the
                    report, and assigns it the descriptor for that topic.&nbsp;
                    <p><b>"Wildcards" and "Truncation Symbols"</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Computers are literal.&nbsp; If you search for "elementary schooling"
                        they will ignore phrases like "elementary school," and "elementary schools"
                        unless told to do otherwise.&nbsp; This is not a problem when a human indexer
                        assigns a descriptor from the search system thesaurus, because the thesaurus
                        will exclude trivial variations of a term.&nbsp; But it is a problem when
                        searching titles, abstracts, and full text.&nbsp; Many search tools allow
                        you to use "wildcards" or "truncation symbols" to indicate the search should
                        include all possible prefixes and/or suffixes of a specified root word.&nbsp;
