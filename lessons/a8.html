        <td colspan="2" height="896">Conclusions pull together the various results
        of the study, consider what they mean, and suggest their importance.&nbsp;
        There are several types of conclusions.&nbsp; The following is one typology:&nbsp;
        <ol>
        <li>
        <b>Findings </b>summarize two or more results.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Interpretations </b>indicate what the results and findings mean within
        the study and within the context of prior research on the topic.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Generalization</b> extrapolates the results or findings beyond the studied
        units.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Implications</b> suggest how the findings may be important for policy,
        practice, theory, and subsequent research.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        <b>Recommendations</b> urge specific actions in respect to policy, practice,
        theory, or subsequent research.</li>
        </ol>
        Conclusions have considerable appeal-indeed they are the objective of any
        research study.&nbsp; They are also usually easily read.&nbsp; For those
        reasons, apprentice scholars may skip most of the research report and jump
        to the conclusions and recommendations.&nbsp; That is a mistake.&nbsp;
        <p>Conclusions and recommendations are not an automatic extension of the
        results.&nbsp; They require careful inference in light of the delimitations
        of the study (the bounds on the questions of the study, the contexts studied,
        the population and sampling frame, and the interventions that occurred
        or were administered) and in light of the limitations of the study (the
        methodological shortcomings).&nbsp; They also require broad knowledge of
        the topic being addressed, they require combining facts and values, and
        they involve some speculation.
        </p><p>Even eminent researchers occasionally blow the conclusions and recommendations
        of a study.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to find a conclusion or two with no
        real support from the results, and occasionally a conclusion will be contradicted
        by the results.&nbsp; The most common reasons for that are fatigue and
        ambition.&nbsp; The conclusions and recommendations cannot be generated
        until the rest of the research is completed, and by then the research has
        usually taken more time and money than expected.&nbsp; So the conclusions
        and recommendations are often hastily assembled.&nbsp; In addition, many
        researchers have hopes of making important contributions, and, at the end,
        they sometimes succumb to concluding and recommending more than is well
        justified by their study.
        </p><p>Whether there is good justification for the conclusions can usually
        be determined by reading the research report.&nbsp; Indeed, readers may
        infer additional conclusions that are well supported by the study but not
        stated in the report.&nbsp; It should be noted, however, that some omissions
        in the report may make some conclusions appear unjustified even though
        the researcher actually has good justification for them.
        </p><p>Common errors when generating the conclusions and recommendations are
        the following:&nbsp;
        </p><ol>
        <li>
        Stating conclusions that the researcher thinks are correct and important,
        but for which the study provides no support.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        Generalizing well beyond the questions, contexts, population, and interventions
        that were actually studied.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        Not adding cautions when there are important limitations in methods and/or
        their execution in the study.<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        Falsely interpreting statistical significance and the lack thereof (This
        is explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623070344/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/a07.html">Lesson A-7</a>).<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        Selectively focusing on some results while ignoring others and the pattern
        of results (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623070344/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/a07.html">Lesson A-7</a>).<br clear="BOTH">
        <br></li>
        
        <li>
        Moving from inference to values and speculation, with using wording that
        clearly indicates that is involved.</li>
