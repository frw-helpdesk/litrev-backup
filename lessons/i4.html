        <td colspan="2">Not all research has to involve an intervention.&nbsp;
          Assessing public opinion, undertaking state-wide student achievement testing
          programs, and examining employee productivity indicators are examples of
          legitimate research that does not require an intervention.&nbsp;
          <p>Nevertheless, a sizeable portion of social research does examine interventions.&nbsp;
            Interventions of interest in research include experimental treatments,
            innovative practices being demonstrated, and naturally occurring events.&nbsp;
            They almost always vary some, even in a set of research studies on a specific
            topic.&nbsp; They may vary not only in their nature, but also in their
            intensity, duration, and continuity.&nbsp; There also can be varying degrees
            of departure between the intended or expect intervention and the one that
            actually occurs.

          <p><b>Means for Integrating Interventions&nbsp;</b>
          </p>
          <p>The following are several means for integrating interventions across
            studies on a given topic:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Portray:</b> Describe the various interventions used and indicate their
              interrelations.&nbsp; Identify what plausible variations in the interventions
              have not yet been researched.<br clear="BOTH">
              <br>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Trace History:</b> Trace how the interventions used have changed over
              history.&nbsp; Indicate what precipitated the changes and what have been
              the consequences of the changes.
            </li>

            <br>&nbsp;
            <li>
              <b>Categorize: </b>Classify the interventions based on similarities and
              differences of underlying characteristics.
            </li>

            <br>&nbsp;
            <li>
              <b>Summarize: </b>Identify the commonalities across the varying interventions.
            </li>

            <br>&nbsp;
            <li>
              <b>Undermine:</b> Identify and document a widespread shortcoming in the
              interventions used.&nbsp; Indicate the implications of that shortcoming
              for our understanding of the body of research on the given topic.
            </li>

            <br>&nbsp;
            <li>
              <b>Synthesize: </b>Invent new interventions based on the best of existing
              ones and other opportunities.
            </li>
          </ul>
