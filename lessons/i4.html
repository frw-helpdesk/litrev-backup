    <td colspan="2">Not all research has to involve an intervention.&nbsp;
    Assessing public opinion, undertaking state-wide student achievement testing
    programs, and examining employee productivity indicators are examples of
    legitimate research that does not require an intervention.&nbsp;
    <p>Nevertheless, a sizeable portion of social research does examine interventions.&nbsp;
    Interventions of interest in research include experimental treatments,
    innovative practices being demonstrated, and naturally occurring events.&nbsp;
    They almost always vary some, even in a set of research studies on a specific
    topic.&nbsp; They may vary not only in their nature, but also in their
    intensity, duration, and continuity.&nbsp; There also can be varying degrees
    of departure between the intended or expect intervention and the one that
    actually occurs.
    </p><p><b>Means for Integrating Interventions&nbsp;</b>
    </p><p>The following are several means for integrating interventions across
    studies on a given topic:
    </p><ul>
    <li>
    <b>Portray:</b> Describe the various interventions used and indicate their
    interrelations.&nbsp; Identify what plausible variations in the interventions
    have not yet been researched.<br clear="BOTH">
    <br></li>
    
    <li>
    <b>Trace History:</b> Trace how the interventions used have changed over
    history.&nbsp; Indicate what precipitated the changes and what have been
    the consequences of the changes.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Categorize: </b>Classify the interventions based on similarities and
    differences of underlying characteristics.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Summarize: </b>Identify the commonalities across the varying interventions.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Undermine:</b> Identify and document a widespread shortcoming in the
    interventions used.&nbsp; Indicate the implications of that shortcoming
    for our understanding of the body of research on the given topic.</li>
    
    <br>&nbsp;
    <li>
    <b>Synthesize: </b>Invent new interventions based on the best of existing
    ones and other opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
