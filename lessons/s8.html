        <td colspan="2">Reference librarians can be very helpful when you don't
        know how to get started with a literature search, but that should not be
        a problem for those who have consulted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065617/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/s01.html">Lesson
        S-1</a> and some of the intervening lessons of this web site.&nbsp;
        <p>Reference librarians can also be a godsend when you have done searches,
        refined them, and still can't find what is needed or still get far more
        hits than you can examine.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Most university students have several options for consulting reference
        librarians.&nbsp; Each has advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;
        </p><p>First they can ask the assistance of whichever reference librarian is
        available when they go to the help desk.&nbsp; That is worth trying, however,
        unless the librarian is the "subject specialist" in your field, he or she
        may not be able to solve tough problems.&nbsp; It is impossible for anyone
        to be expert with all the search tools that are now available.&nbsp; Consequently,
        most large libraries have the reference librarians specialize in a few
        broad fields.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Second, students may be able to submit questions by e-mail to their
        reference librarians.&nbsp; GWU students can do that by clicking at "Ask
        Us" from the bottom toolbar of the Gelman Library homepage or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065617/http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/ref/index.htm">http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/ref/index.htm</a>.&nbsp;
        If the student is having a tough problem, the query will probably be given
        to the subject specialist.&nbsp; Despite that, this may not be the optimal
        strategy for a difficult search problem.&nbsp; It may require several e-mails
        back and forth to determine exactly what you want to find and what you
        have already tried.&nbsp;
        </p><p>Third, starting in Fall 2000, students can make an appointment for research
        assistance.&nbsp; To do so, go to the Reference and Information Desk on
        the first floor of Gelman.&nbsp; A session with an appropriate subject
        specialist librarian takes 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity
        of the research problem.&nbsp; Two advantages of making such an appointment
        are that it facilitates dialogue and also usually the student can watch
        the librarian try the search, often several different ways, and learn from
        that.&nbsp;
        </p><blockquote>The GWU Gelman Library specialist for the Graduate School of
        Education and Human Development is:</blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <blockquote>Janice Houck:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065617/mailto:jhouck@gwu.edu">jhouck@gwu.edu</a>&nbsp;

        </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        Fourth, students usually can phone or e-mail the staff of the search system
        that they have been using and ask a human being for help with failed searches.&nbsp;
        If you dig around enough on the web pages of search tools, you usually
        can find contact information for such help.&nbsp; In the "First Aid" sections
        of&nbsp; the Lessons for <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065617/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/s03.html">ERIC</a></i>,

        and <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623065617/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/s05.html">ABI/Inform</a></i>,
        there is information on how to contact expert help with those systems.&nbsp;

        </p><p>The following suggestions will assist you in securing quick and effective
        help when consulting reference librarians about failed searches:&nbsp;
        <br>&nbsp;
        </p><blockquote>1)&nbsp; Recheck Lesson S-1 and applicable Lessons S-2 to S-7
        to make sure that you have applied the search strategies explained there.&nbsp;
        <p>2)&nbsp; Have a clear idea of what you are looking for.&nbsp; Try to
        define it two or three different ways.&nbsp;
        </p><p>3)&nbsp; Keep notes of how you specified the failed searches and provide
        that information to the reference librarian.&nbsp;
        </p><p>4)&nbsp; Don't be surprised if the librarian needs several tries to
        find what you want.&nbsp; This searching is part science and part art.&nbsp;
        </p><p>5)&nbsp; If you can, watch how the librarian does the searches and learn
        from his or her example.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
