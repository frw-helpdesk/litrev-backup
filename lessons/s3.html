        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>ERIC</i> is the single best index to scholarly
        and professional literature in education.&nbsp; It&nbsp; now indexes and
        annotates or abstracts a total of more than 1 million journal articles,
        monographs, reports, and books. Its coverage of education is broad and
        deep, from preschool to higher education, from curriculum and counseling
        to school finance and policy.&nbsp; <i>ERIC</i> indexes almost 1,000 journals,
        dating back to 1996. It comprehensively indexes most of the main journals
        in education and also selectively indexes education-related articles in
        the major journals of other fields such as psychology, sociology, and economics.
        <i>ERIC</i>
        also has arrangements with more than 2,000 organizations to receive their
        monographs, reports, conference papers, and other publications for review
        and possible indexing.&nbsp;
        <p><b>Advantages</b>
        </p><ul>
        <li>
        <i>ERIC</i>'s coverage of the education literature is far greater than
        any other index.</li>
        
        <li>
        <i>ERIC</i> permits complex searches.&nbsp; Each resource is assigned standardized
        "Descriptors" by professional indexers.&nbsp; The full set of descriptors
        is specified in the "Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors".&nbsp; <i>ERIC</i>
        can also search words and phrases in the annotation or abstract that <i>ERIC</i>
        stores for each resource.</li>
        
        <li>
        Although <i>ERIC</i> currently provides only a small number of full text
        documents online, most documents indexed by <i>ERIC</i>, except the journal
        articles and books, can be ordered in microfiche or hard copy from the
        <i>ERIC
        Document Reproduction Service </i>at<i> </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.edrs.com/">http://www.edrs.com</a>.&nbsp;
        Many large university libraries, including GWU, have this microfiche collection.</li>
        
        <li>
        Each year the <i>ERIC</i> system produces about 100 brief reviews of&nbsp;
        research on topics of high interest to practitioners.&nbsp; The full text
        of these "ERIC Digests"<i> </i>is available online at&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.ed.gov/databases/ERIC_Digests/index/">http://www.ed.gov/databases/ERIC_Digests/index/</a>
        .</li>
        
        <li>
        <i>ERIC</i> also maintains a "Calendar of Education-Related Conferences"
        at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://webprod.aspensys.com/education/ericconf/eric_cal/SearchForm.asp">http://webprod.aspensys.com/education/ericconf/eric_cal/SearchForm.asp</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Pitfalls</b>
        <ul>
        <li>
        The main weakness of <i>ERIC</i> is that it provides few full text documents
        online.&nbsp; Some of the the documents are available online in full text
        from other sources, but <i>ERIC</i> doesn't currently tell you which ones
        and at what URL.&nbsp; (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/s09.html">Lesson
        S-9</a> for how to find the full text of some journals and other publications
        online.)</li>
        
        <li>
        <i>ERIC</i> indexes only a few dissertations.&nbsp; Most dissertations
        are covered by <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations">UMI Dissertation
        Abstracts</a></i> (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.gwu.edu/~litrev/s06.html">Lesson
        S-6</a>).</li>

        <p>The following resources will help you get started using ERIC in a powerful
        and efficient manner.&nbsp;
        </p><ol>
        <li>
        The main <i>ERIC</i> Web site is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.accesseric.org/">http://www.accesseric.org</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It provides detailed information about the <i>ERIC</i> system and links
        to four Web-based search engines, but little information on how to do an
        <i>ERIC</i>
        Search.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
        The <i>AskERIC</i> Web site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://ericir.syr.edu/Eric/">http://ericir.syr.edu/Eric/</a>
        provides free access to the entire <i>ERIC</i> database going back to 1966.&nbsp;
        It includes fairly good instructions on how to search <i>ERIC</i> from
        that site.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
        The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.eriche.org/">ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education</a>
        has produced a great interactive tutorial for learning to use the <i>AskERIC</i>
        site.&nbsp; It will help you become moderately proficient at doing <i>ERIC</i>
        searches in less than two hours. Try it out at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.eriche.org/Workshops/searching.html">http://www.eriche.org/Workshops/searching.html</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
        <i>ERIC</i> can also be accessed by GW students by going to the Gelman
        Library home page, clicking on "Databases", then clicking on "ALADIN 'Article
        and Other Databases'", selecting "Alphabetical List" and finally clicking
        on "ERIC (education)". The advantage to doing this is that it connects
        you to the <i>OVID</i> metasearch engine which allows up to four other
        database searches in conjunction with your ERIC search.&nbsp; For more
        information on <i>OVID</i>, see <a href="s09.html">Lesson S-9</a>.</li>

        <p>If you encounter trouble when doing <i>ERIC</i> searches, review the
        above Trail Guides again.&nbsp; If that doesn't help, try your reference
        librarian.&nbsp; If he or she can't help, contact the search specialists
        at<i> AskERIC</i>, indicating very specifically what you have been trying
        to find and what you tried unsuccessfully.&nbsp; The search specialist
        can be reached by e-mail at askeric@ericir.syr.edu or through a form at
