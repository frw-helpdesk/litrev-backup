      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" height="896"><i>ERIC</i> is the single best index to scholarly
          and professional literature in education. It now indexes and
          annotates or abstracts a total of more than 1 million journal articles,
          monographs, reports, and books. Its coverage of education is broad and
          deep, from preschool to higher education, from curriculum and counseling
          to school finance and policy. <i>ERIC</i> indexes almost 1,000 journals,
          dating back to 1996. It comprehensively indexes most of the main journals
          in education and also selectively indexes education-related articles in
          the major journals of other fields such as psychology, sociology, and economics.
          <i>ERIC</i>
          also has arrangements with more than 2,000 organizations to receive their
          monographs, reports, conference papers, and other publications for review
          and possible indexing.
          <p><b>Advantages</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>ERIC</i>'s coverage of the education literature is far greater than
              any other index.
            </li>

            <li>
              <i>ERIC</i> permits complex searches. Each resource is assigned standardized
              "Descriptors" by professional indexers. The full set of descriptors
              is specified in the "Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors". <i>ERIC</i>
              can also search words and phrases in the annotation or abstract that <i>ERIC</i>
              stores for each resource.
            </li>

            <li>
              Although <i>ERIC</i> currently provides only a small number of full text
              documents online, most documents indexed by <i>ERIC</i>, except the journal
              articles and books, can be ordered in microfiche or hard copy from the
              <i>ERIC
                Document Reproduction Service </i>at<i> </i><a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.edrs.com/">http://www.edrs.com</a>.
              Many large university libraries, including GWU, have this microfiche collection.
            </li>

            <li>
              Each year the <i>ERIC</i> system produces about 100 brief reviews of
              research on topics of high interest to practitioners. The full text
              of these "ERIC Digests"<i> </i>is available online at <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.ed.gov/databases/ERIC_Digests/index/">http://www.ed.gov/databases/ERIC_Digests/index/</a>
              .</li>

            <li>
              <i>ERIC</i> also maintains a "Calendar of Education-Related Conferences"
              at <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://webprod.aspensys.com/education/ericconf/eric_cal/SearchForm.asp">http://webprod.aspensys.com/education/ericconf/eric_cal/SearchForm.asp</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Pitfalls</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main weakness of <i>ERIC</i> is that it provides few full text documents
              online. Some of the the documents are available online in full text
              from other sources, but <i>ERIC</i> doesn't currently tell you which ones
              and at what URL. (See <a href="../lessons/s9.html">Lesson
                S-9</a> for how to find the full text of some journals and other publications
              online.)</li>

            <li>
              <i>ERIC</i> indexes only a few dissertations. Most dissertations
              are covered by <i><a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations">UMI Dissertation
                  Abstracts</a></i> (See <a href="../lessons/s6.html">Lesson
                S-6</a>).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../assets/map.gif" height="45" width="30" align="ABSCENTER"><b>Trail Guide</b>
          <p>The following resources will help you get started using ERIC in a powerful
            and efficient manner.

            <li>
              The main <i>ERIC</i> Web site is at <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.accesseric.org/">http://www.accesseric.org</a>
              It provides detailed information about the <i>ERIC</i> system and links
              to four Web-based search engines, but little information on how to do an
              <i>ERIC</i>
              Search.

          </ol>

              The <i>AskERIC</i> Web site at <a

              provides free access to the entire <i>ERIC</i> database going back to 1966.
              It includes fairly good instructions on how to search <i>ERIC</i> from
              that site.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190623064802/http://www.eriche.org/">ERIC Clearinghouse on
                Higher Education</a>
              has produced a great interactive tutorial for learning to use the <i>AskERIC</i>
              site. It will help you become moderately proficient at doing <i>ERIC</i>
              searches in less than two hours. Try it out at: <a

          <ol>
            <li>
              <i>ERIC</i> can also be accessed by GW students by going to the Gelman
              Library home page, clicking on "Databases", then clicking on "ALADIN 'Article
              and Other Databases'", selecting "Alphabetical List" and finally clicking
              on "ERIC (education)". The advantage to doing this is that it connects
              you to the <i>OVID</i> metasearch engine which allows up to four other
              database searches in conjunction with your ERIC search. For more
              information on <i>OVID</i>, see <a href="../lessons/s9.html">Lesson S-9</a>.

          <p>If you encounter trouble when doing <i>ERIC</i> searches, review the
            above Trail Guides again. If that doesn't help, try your reference
            librarian. If he or she can't help, contact the search specialists
            at<i> AskERIC</i>, indicating very specifically what you have been trying
            to find and what you tried unsuccessfully. The search specialist
            can be reached by e-mail at askeric@ericir.syr.edu or through a form at
