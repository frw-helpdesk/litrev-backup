* # Description
  - https://www2.gwu.edu/~litrev/index.html was a website developed by GWU and had many contributors such as Dr. Gregg Jackson, Dr. Adrianna Kezar, Maria Kozi and Nina de las Alas. The site was launched as early as 1999, and last saw an update on July 30, 2006.

  
  - ```Acknowledgments: This Web site was developed by Dr. Gregg Jackson, Dr. Adrianna Kezar, Maria Kozi and Nina de las Alas, in the Graduate School of Education and Human Development at The George Washington University. Dr. Jackson is an Associate Professor of Education Policy and Coordinator of the Education Policy Program. Dr. Kezar is an Assistant Professor of Higher Education and Director of the ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education. Ms. Kozi is the Information Services Coordinator at the ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education and a freelance Web designer. Ms. de las Alas is an M.A. candidate in the Education Policy Program and a research assistant. The Graduate School provided a Technology Project Grant to cover direct expenses associated with developing this Web site. Several faculty and students provided helpful feedback on the prototype. ```
  

  - INC000000984198 was a ticket opened in our system on August 23, 2022, Prof. Yas Nakib was requesting info on this page, which no longer worked for him. He used it during his time here and was trying to find a way to view its contents again. This link, however, was a flat 404.

  - After talking with a very helpful librarian, Rachel, she discovered we can view the webpage through Archive.org's WBM. After "taking in" this ticket so to speak, I wanted to try and work with Prof. Nakib to get this information for him in an easily consumable way. At the same time, I saw this as an opportunity to continue practicing aspects of web development by refactoring this page and deploying it as it would have been used back in the day. Choosing to revitalize this page was a bit dull and tedious at times, but in the end, it was a can of worms that I am glad I opened.

  <!-- #### Final Regards
  - I'm glad that I was the one to grab this ticket. I think the members of our team would have happily done the initial research to determine that this site has been decommissioned, but with everything else going on, this inquiry would have been in a limbo state for a while. This was something that I saw as an opportunity of service and growth, which at the day is what it's all about, eh? Thanks Prof. Nakib for the project, and for being patient while I figured out what the best thing to do was in my context. Links are a bit outdated, I must admit, but I see why you would have considered this worth preserving. I hope it helps you create a new iteration that is modern and exciting!  -->
