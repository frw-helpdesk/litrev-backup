        The accumulated research literature on any given topic is a potential mountain
        lookout to interested scholars and practitioners.&nbsp; It can indicate
        what knowledge is well verified, what should be considered tentative, and
        what is without any foundation.&nbsp; It can suggest new theories that
        better organize disparate knowledge and better predict the future.&nbsp;
        It can point to the unknowns that would benefit from further research.&nbsp;
        And it can suggest methodologies for research addressing those unknowns.&nbsp;
        <p>The accumulated research literature on any given topic is also a potential
          snake pit.&nbsp; The good literature is accompanied by other literature
          that is based on rhetoric, wishful thinking, speculation, invalid findings
          from poorly designed studies, and duplicitous attempts to mislead.&nbsp;
        <p>Whether the literature helps you gain perspective or clouds your vision
          will depend on how you search for the literature, how you critique individual
          studies, and how you integrate across studies.&nbsp; This web site will
          help you with all three tasks.&nbsp;
